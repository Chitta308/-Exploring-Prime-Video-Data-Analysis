# -Exploring-Prime-Video-Data-Analysis

I recently worked on an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Amazon Prime Video content using Python. The goal was to uncover insights into the movies and TV shows available on the platform. Here’s what I found! 👇

🔍 Key Steps in the Analysis: ✅ Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, filled gaps, and standardized data. ✅ Data Transformation: Converted dates, categorized content, and extracted useful features. ✅ Visualization: Used Seaborn & Matplotlib to uncover trends in the dataset.

📊 Interesting Insights: 📌 Movie Dominance: 80%+ of the content consists of movies, while TV shows make up the rest. 📌 Top Content-Producing Countries: The United States, India, and the United Kingdom lead in Prime Video content production. 📌 Trends Over Time: A surge in content additions has been observed in recent years, especially post-2015. 📌 Popular Age Ratings: Most content falls under the 13+ and TV-MA categories. 📌 Duration Analysis: Movies typically range between 60-120 minutes, while TV shows mostly have single-season runs.

📉 Visual Representations: 🔹 Bar charts for content distribution across countries. 🔹 Pie charts for content ratings. 🔹 Histograms for movie release year distribution. 🔹 Heatmaps for correlation analysis.

💡 Tech Stack Used: Python 🐍 | Pandas | Seaborn | Matplotlib | NumPy
This analysis provided deep insights into Prime Video’s content strategy, helping to understand the trends shaping the streaming industry. 📽️📡
